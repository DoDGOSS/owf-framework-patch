We believe that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers a better solution to many problems than do existing technologies such as EJB. 
AOP Alliance intends to facilitate and standardize the use of AOP to enhance existing middleware environments (such as J2EE), or development environements (e.g. JBuilder, Eclipse). 
The AOP Alliance also aims to ensure interoperability between Java/J2EE AOP implementations to build a larger AOP community.
